# Readme of the link:

Since GitHub has a limitation on the number of files that can be uploaded, we separated the dataset into 4 parts to ensure that they can be uploaded and managed smoothly. The documents are listed according to the initials of the stationsâ€™ names and the occurrence time of the events.

For example, for a document named as :

1. They are: [station name]. [Year]. [Date]. [Hour]_results_[phase type]_[quality].pdf
2. The date is expressed as the Julian day
3. The hour is expressed as the hours of the day

You may download the corresponding part of the files as needed. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact us (wujing_js@mail.iggcas.ac.cn).

Thank you for your understanding and support!
